                    <p>A Game of Thrones is a contemporary masterpiece of fantasy. The cold is returning to Winterfell,
                        where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime. A time of conflict has arisen in the
                        Stark
                        family, as they are pulled from the safety of their home into a whirlpool of tragedy, betrayal,
                        assassination, plots and counterplots. Each decision and action carries with it the potential
                        for
                        conflict as several prominent families, comprised of lords, ladies, soldiers, sorcerers,
                        assassins
                        and bastards, are pulled together in the most deadly game of all--the game of thrones.</p>
                    <p>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They
                        set
                        forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with
                        excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and
                        his
                        brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of
                        Bran's
                        life.

                        The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling,
                        his
                        sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of
                        it.
                        He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said,
                        slavers
                        and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead
                        of
                        night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long
                        Night to
                        sire terrible half-human children.</p>
